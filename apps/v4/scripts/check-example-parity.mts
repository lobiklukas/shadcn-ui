// [FORCE-UI] Reports per-component example-set gaps between the React `base`
// reference (apps/v4/examples/base) and each framework port's demo directory.
//
// `framework-components:check` only guarantees that a component's *doc page*
// exists for a base. Nothing checked that the port actually ships the same set
// of examples the page is supposed to document, which is how Angular ended up
// with a single `accordion-demo` against base's seven accordion examples.
// docs/component-docs-standard.md is the written rule this script measures.
//
// What it does, per preview framework and per component slug the framework has
// already ported (per FRAMEWORK_COMPONENTS, the generated manifest):
//
//   * counts the flat, top-level demo files under
//     apps/preview-{previewDir}/src/{demoDir}/*.{demoExt}
//   * counts the same-slug example files under apps/v4/examples/base
//   * reports the slugs where the port has fewer examples than base
//
// Framework identity (previewDir/demoDir/demoExt/bases) comes from
// registry/frameworks.ts and the component lists come from
// lib/framework-components.ts - neither is re-hardcoded here, per the rule in
// CONTRIBUTING.md's "Previews and examples" section.
//
// Reporting only: it always exits 0. The Angular port (and, to a lesser
// extent, Ember) carries a large, known, pre-existing gap that is being closed
// component-by-component, so failing on it would block every unrelated PR. CI
// runs it with `continue-on-error: true`; see .github/workflows/code-check.yml
// for the condition to make it blocking.
//
// Usage: npx tsx --tsconfig ./tsconfig.scripts.json ./scripts/check-example-parity.mts
// (wired up as the `example-parity:check` npm script)
